  "Awesome community tucked away in the industrial section of New Brunswick. Very wholesome but old school atmosphere suitable for all levels and ages. You'll get scrubs like me working on the heavy bag next to a guy preparing for an amateur bout, and we're both welcomed like family. Also glad this gym takes COVID seriously and takes extra precautions and care to provide a safe place for people to work out. Good people, good vibes. Great boxing gym!",
  "Brunswick Boxing stars and JT are a great gym and a great family. I recently moved up here from Florida and they have shown me nothing but kindness. As a matter of fact my first week I left my wallet here and JT found it for me and returned it with everything in it. Other than that itâ€™s a great place to train, great coaches and a great place for the kids.",  
  "So far the only boxing place I have been where you really can practice boxing and actually learn. They have ring and after some time it will be possible to have real fight, it up to you and your coach when you will be ready to go to ring", "Awesome...I wasn't alone for long...dope place" ];
